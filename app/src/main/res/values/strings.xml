    <string name="exampleNews">"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have rejected calls to resign, despite being fined by police for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street in June 2020.

The prime minister, the chancellor and the PM's wife all received fixed penalty notices for attending a birthday gathering for the PM in No 10.

As a result, Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law.

All three apologised, but opposition MPs say the PM and Mr Sunak must quit.

Mr Johnson said he felt 'an even greater sense of obligation to deliver', while the chancellor said he was 'focused on delivering for the British people'."</string>
